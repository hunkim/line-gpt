ChatGPT is now available on Line! With this integration, you can talk to ChatGPT directly from your Line app. Plus, you can also use UpOCR to send images to ChatGPT, giving it additional context to generate even better responses.

Our chatbot now has a new feature that allows users to set its persona using three different comments:

* To check the current persona of the chatbot, type **"persona?"**.
* To set a new persona for the chatbot, type **"persona: new persona"**, where "new persona" is the new persona you want to set. For example, "persona: friendly".
* To reset the persona of the chatbot to its default state, type **"persona reset"**.
By changing the persona of the chatbot, you can make it behave in different ways depending on your preferences. Give it a try!
